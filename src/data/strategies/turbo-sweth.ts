    description: `
    The initial phase of Turbo SWETH will concentrate on optimizing ticks within Uniswap v3 SWETH-ETH pairs due to the vaultâ€™s potential to capture sustainable real yield. The vault may also undertake a "peg defense" strategy by cost-effectively acquiring SWETH from the market and establishing a narrow liquidity range close to parity. This strategic move aims to arbitrage the SWETH peg to its implied value enhancing yield for vault users.

    Lastly, the vault will have the option to allocate to SWETH pools on Balancer if yields are favorable, ensuring that Turbo SWETH users access the best possible yields. As SWETH's presence continues to expand across the Liquid Staking DeFi ecosystem and Sommelier's roster of protocol integrations widens, the Turbo SWETH vault stands poised to tap into emerging yield opportunities.

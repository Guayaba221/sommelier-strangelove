The goal is to outperform a static strategy of lending any single stablecoin.

      strategy: `This strategy involves observation of several variables including Aave interest rates, rate volatility, gas fees, slippage estimations, and TVL. This data is the input for a custom predictive model which recommends position adjustments periodically. The entire process is automated as the model delivers a feed to Sommelier validators who relay necessary function calls to the Cellar.

      "somm alpha": `The alpha Sommelier delivers for this strategy is generated by a brilliant model that determines the precise moment that is best to capitalize on new market conditions. For the first time in DeFi history, you can benefit from a dynamic model rather than relying on static vault architecture. Cellars are not limited by rigid smart contract code which only allows positions to be adjusted under a narrow set of circumstances.

      The Aave Strategy uses high-powered predictive analytics to respond instantly when opportunity arises. Every second, we are monitoring and predicting APYs, gas fees, price volatility, liquidity, slippage and more. Rather than a simple formula such as "if gas fees <= current_apy/12, {claim_rewards}", the Aave Strategy is continually primed with real-time data points to make intelligent decisions. We bring statistics to DeFi without compromising decentralization. This has never been possible until now.`,
